# Rest-API-Development
Developed a Student Grade Portal that incorporates various REST APIs to establish relationships between Student, Course, and Grade tables. The system enables the allocation and modification of grades for multiple courses. Utilized Spring Boot and H2 database to develop the APIs, and Postman for testing purposes.
